# Data Hazards: accompanying code 

This repository sits alongside the manuscript reporting on our evaluation of the Data Hazards project through a series of workshops.
[You can see more at our Open Science Framework project here.](https://osf.io/3fv7t/)

This repository provides the code used to create the statistics and graphs reported in the paper. 

Python 3.9 is required to install and run the required packages (see `requirements.txt`).
